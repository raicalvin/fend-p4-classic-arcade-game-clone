# Web App: Classic Arcade Game

## Project Information

### About

This project was built for my Front End Nanodegree from Udacity. The project focused on object-oriented JavaScript and we were responsible for developing and managing the enemy and player instances of the game. The goal was to create a game where a user could control the player and move them around the board to the river while avoiding incoming enemies. One the player has reached the water, the player score increments and the player begins the game from the bottom of the board.

### Concepts

- Object-oriented JavaScript was explored in the creation of this game
- Event listeners, canvas drawing, and function scopes and closures were major concepts in this games development
- The game had to implement a provided game engine that effectively draws the canvas and gameboard continuously to simulate enemy and player movement

## User Interface

The gameboard itself was created using provided assets for the board pieces, player object, and enemy objects. A small score-tracker is present below the game board to count how many times the player successfully completes a round.
